	node-gyp (mpn package)

Windows:

	(possibly more, see error when build fails)

How to build:

$ node-gyp configure
$ node-gyp build


NOTE:

"Linker error: could not find 'wordexpr'"
"Linker error: could not find 'wordfree'"

Building on windows may require you to add a reference to the files ./wordexp.h and ./wordexp.ccp inside ./build/binding.sln
This can be done by opening ./build/binding.sln in visual studio and "Add > Existing Item" to "Solution 'binding' > wordexp > .." in the Solution Explorer window.

I have not yet built this under a unix system, but the same might have to be done.
